# WeekÂ 7â€“8: Project Implementation

Welcome to WeeksÂ 7 andÂ 8! Itâ€™s time to apply what youâ€™ve learned in a handsâ€‘on project. Choose a topic that excites you and follow the guidelines below.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Project Guidelines

1. **Topic Selection**  
   - Pick any vision or visionâ€‘related topic you like. Some suggestions:  
     - Stock/timeâ€‘series analysis with LSTMs or Transformers  
     - Biomedical image segmentation  
     - Object detection or instance segmentation  
     - Image colorization or reconstruction with GANs  
     - Any other creative idea you want to explore

2. **Baseline & Progress**  
   - You may start from an existing repository and use pretrained weights.  
   - You **must** show measurable progress: additional training, custom layers, data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, etc.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Include **quantitative** metrics (e.g., accuracy, IoU, F1 score, PSNR/SSIM)  
   - Show **qualitative** results (visual examples, before/after comparisons)

4. **Documentation**  
   - **Jupyter Notebook:** Write clear Markdown sections for motivation, methodology, and results  
   - **Python Scripts:** Provide a `README.md` explaining your pipeline, dependencies, and how to run/train/evaluate

5. **Submission**  
   - Create or navigate to the `week_7-8/` folder in your repo  
   - Upload all code, notebooks, data loaders, model weights, and results  
   - Include a **project README** with:  
     - Project overview & goals  
     - Setup instructions (environment, dataset links)  
     - Usage examples (train, evaluate, visualize)  
     - Key findings & discussion  
     - References & acknowledgments
