# Week 1â€“2

Welcome to Weeks 1 and 2 of the Summer of Science â€™25 Computer Vision track!  
Below youâ€™ll find two task tracksâ€”pick the one that fits your background.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Task Set 1  
*For those new to computer vision or with limited time.*

1. **Review Lectures 1â€“6**  
   - Visit the Spring 2017 syllabus:  
     https://cs231n.stanford.edu/2017/syllabus.html  
   - Watch Lectures 1â€“6 and skim any linked resources (slides, notes).

2. **Complete Assignment #1**  
   - Solve all 5 questions from:  
     https://cs231n.github.io/assignments2024/assignment1/

3. **Prepare Your Submission**  
   - Follow the instructions on the assignment page **or** simply upload all your solution files as-is.

4. **Publish to GitHub**  
   - Create a repo.  
   - Add a folder named `week_1-2/`.  
   - Copy your solution files into it.

## ðŸ“‹ Task Set 2  
*For those already familiar with the first 6 lecturesâ€™ concepts.*

1. **Build a CNN from Scratch**  
   - Use only **NumPy** (no TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch).  
   - Implement layers, activations, loss functions, etc. as functions/classes.

2. **Train on MNIST**  
   - Use MNIST: https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/mnist  
   - You may use scikit-learn or any simple loaderâ€”preserve the train/test split.

3. **Experiment & Compare**  
   - Try different architectures and record test accuracies.  
   - Re-implement your best model in **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**.  
   - Compare performanceâ€”note any differences and hypothesize why.

4. **Prepare Your Submission**  
   - **Preferred:** Jupyter Notebook with clear Markdown!  
   - **Alternative:** .py class files + a `README.md` explaining your code structure.  
   - Place all files under `week_1-2/` in your repo.
